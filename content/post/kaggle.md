> Being a software engineer and You dont Knnnnow machine learning! You will get out of fashion pretty soon!

Those are not my words. But, have been hearing them a lot now! So, I being a scared engineer, took up some online courses (yea, the Andrew NG one..) and read few books. But, I never got one thing - _Confidence_. So here I am, about to undertake a journey to gain that much needed confidence. Also, I have decided to blog about it as well. So that, someday somebody might get benefit out of it. 

_Always find a companion!_ However passionate you are, there will be a time when your passion might just dwindled away. So, make someone accountable who will be your Gary Vee in case you feel like abandoning it. So, without further ado, lets kickstart this arduous journey to become a confident data scientist. 

_Try try, until you succeed!_

In the college times, we used to practise programming on Codechef, remember?! Similarly, there is a platform for machine learning as well, where a normal engineer like you and me, can use his skillsets to solve some real world problems. _So lets start Kaggling!_  And also, if you persist and become just too good, you might will be able to earn a few extra bucks. 

_**Getting started!!**_ Let me give you a quick introduction to Kaggle's ecosystem. These are some constructs which any kaggler should be aware of:

[_Ranking:_](https://www.kaggle.com/progression) All the newcomers in Kaggle are called Novice. And so are we ðŸ˜ž. There are 5 levels - Novices, Contributors, Experts, Masters and Grandmasters. So, our aim is to become the Grandmaster. Sounding too far fetched, huh?! But, as its said dreaming big is the first step to success. So, up for the challenge?!

[_Competitions:_](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) Big companies host competitions where they provide us with training and testing datasets. We need to come up with a model, predict the output and submit the results. Just like codechef, it creates leaderboard based on the submissions. Topers usually get cash prizes as well. There are discussion topics as well, where you can post your queries and can get quick reply from Kaggle team and other kagglers.
	
[_Tutorials:_](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) Kaggle has provided us with tutorials to impart away just the minimum knowledge, so that we can get started with the competitions. Dont spend too much time on it, as you might forget it. Just have a glance over it, and come back when needed.

With the boring stuff done, lets get started on this journey together... 

Off to Kaggle.. ðŸ˜€
