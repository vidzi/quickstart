I am Lead Product Engineer at [Morph.ai](https://morph.ai/), where I help in developing chatbots to boost marketing and lead-generation campaigns for businesses.

Before that, I was a part of the early development team of [Sprinklr](https://www.sprinklr.com/), and saw it grow into a billion dollar tech startup. 

I am crazy about all the backend things - right from servers to product architecture to scalbility to machine learning.
